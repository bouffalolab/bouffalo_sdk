(v1.3.1)
    ENH:
    1. Fixed the flow error-related issue caused by executing sdio_reinit.
    2. Device version: v1.3.1:0, host v1.9.
    3. Fixed the problem of manually modifying SDIO_DNLD_MAX_PORTS to 4 in
    different projects.
    4. Improved throughput; the current version achieves up to 30 Mbps in
    iperf TCP transmission.
    5. Added debugging tools to the device for providing more information for
    analysis in case of exceptions.
    6. Fixed the issue of data packets entering an exception before being sent completely in low-power scenarios.

    TODO:
    1. Test in low-power scenarios.
    2. Refactor the software to support forward and backward compatibility.
    3. Host and device share the same version number.
    4. Support USB network card.

(v1.3.0)
    NEW:
    1. Add hostrouter component.
    2. Device-side version number: 1.3.0:0

    TODO:
    1. For SDIO communication, it is necessary to modify SDIO_DNLD_MAX_PORTS in
    bl_sdio_eth.h to 4, which is unreasonable and needs to be fixed.
    2. Host and device share the same version number.
    3. Low-power scenarios need testing.
    4. Software needs to be refactored to support both forward and backward
    compatibility.
    5. USB network card support is required.

For Versions Before (v1.3.0):
    Todo
