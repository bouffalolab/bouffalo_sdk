This document describes how to send and receive AT commands through a TTY device file on Linux.

1. Using Linux Shell Commands
First, set the TTY attributes to raw mode:

stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 raw

Send an AT command using the echo command. Ensure that the AT command ends with \r\n:

echo -ne "AT\r\n" > /dev/ttyACM0

In another terminal, continuously read from the TTY device:

cat /dev/ttyACM0

This will display the received data.

2. Using a Programmatic Approach
You can refer to the source code in the following directory:

components/net/netbus/host_router/host_linux/userspace/

The tty_at_helper tool serves as both an AT command communication tool and a programming reference for sending and receiving AT commands. This tool reads commands from stdin, writes them to the TTY device, and displays data received from the TTY device on stdout.

Build and Compile
Navigate to the userspace directory and execute:

make tty_at_helper

For cross-compilation, please configure accordingly.

Usage
./tty_at_helper /dev/ttyACM0

Notes
1. The above examples assume that the TTY device file is /dev/ttyACM0. Please confirm the actual device name before performing operations.
2. A TTY device can be opened by multiple processes. Ensure that only one process reads from it, as data may be lost if consumed by another reader.
3. For details on AT command usage, refer to the relevant documentation.
