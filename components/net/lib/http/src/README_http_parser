HTTP Parser Support in Zephyr
-----------------------------

The http-parser library* from the nodejs project is a downstream of an
externally maintained open source project. The original upstream code
can be found at:

https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser/releases/tag/v2.7.1
https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser/archive/v2.7.1.tar.gz

NOTE: The portions which relate to URL parsing have been split out into
http_parser_url.c (originally located in http_parser.c).

* "http-parser" is the project's name, "http_parser" is used in filenames.
