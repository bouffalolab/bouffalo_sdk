 REVISION HISTORY

 Description: Change buffer type to UChar

 Description: Update comments

 Description: Updated a comment that MT did not get around to
 before the end of his contract.

 Description: add a new API to decode audioSpecificConfig separately, the same
              change has been made on 32-bits version (element \main\2)

 Description: add a new API to reset history buffer, the same change has been
              made on a 32-bits version(element \nd.e0352.wjin\1)

 INCLUDE DESCRIPTION

 Main header file for the Packet Video MP4/AAC audio decoder library. The
 constants, structures, and functions defined within this file, along with
 a basic data types header file, is all that is needed to use and communicate
 with the library. The internal data structures within the library are
 purposely hidden.

 ---* Need description of the input buffering. *-------

 ---* Need an example of calling the library here *----
