## FreeRTOS+POSIX: Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX threading wrapper) for FreeRTOS

The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. FreeRTOS+POSIX implements *a small subset* of the [POSIX threading](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/threads.html) API. This subset allows application developers familiar with POSIX API to develop a FreeRTOS application using POSIX like threading primitives. FreeRTOS+POSIX does not implement more than 80% of the POSIX API. Therefore, an existing POSIX compliant application or a POSIX compliant library cannot be ported to run on FreeRTOS Kernel using only this wrapper.
