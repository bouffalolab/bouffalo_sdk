## How to Connect an HOST Board and a BFLB Board Using Jumper Wires

The hardware wiring diagram between the HOST and BFLB is shown in the figure.

### Jumper Wires

If you are using the BFLB development board, please connect the jumpers as followsï¼š

| BFLB        | HOST      |
|-------------|-----------|
