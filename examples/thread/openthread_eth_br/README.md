## How to run

### Hardwares

  Prepare:
    - One board with Ethernet Interface, named OTBR, which flashes this example.
      - Please configure `CONFIG_ETHERNET_PHY` in proj.conf to specific ethernet PHY driver for your board.
    - One board, named OTCLI, which flashes openthread command line example.

- Test PC machine

  - Description on operations and commands are based on Linux-base operating system.
  - `Windows`, `Macos` and etc may work with this example.  

- An router

  - Must have IPv4 DHCP function

  - IPv6 DHCP is not a must

    Since current OTBR implementation only supports stateless IPv6 address. Some legacy routers in the field may be not good compatible with this IPv6 address allocation, so please disable IPv6 function in these kind of routers to try this example.

### Steps

  - Connect OTBR and your test PC station in to same router with Ethernet cable.

  - Open OTBR UART, power up or reset the board.
    > OTBR will acquire IPv4 address at its Ethernet Interface.
    >
    > After IPv4 address assigned at Ethernet interface. OTBR starts/attaches Thread network, and plays Thread Border Routing forwarding.

- After OTBR gets IPv4 address from Wi-Fi AP, check Thread state becomes Leader, this may take a minute, try more. Then, go to next step.

  ```shell
  # Get Thread state with command otc state.
  # Try more times in minute to check Thread state becomes to leader
  bouffalolab />otc state
  state
  leader
  Done
  ```

- Get dataset of Thread network from OTBR

  ```shell
  # Get active dataset as hex string format with command otc dataset active -x
  bouffalolab />otc dataset active -x
  dataset active -x
  0e080000000000010000000300001735060004001fffe002086e0f33c1aa1076d30708fd563c8a2072356f05101f5be8fb42b487278a27619c7a0f2470030f4f70656e5468726561642d3765363501027e6504107ccd496e4c41be0651547fe30355ff330c0402a0f7f8
  Done
  ```
  > hex string of dataset has all information of Thread network, include channel, panid network, etc. Copy that for step to attach OTCLI to OTBR network.

- Get IPv6 OMR prefix information from OTBR

  - OMR prefix belongs Thread network domain
  
  - IPv6 addresses using OMR prefix which are allocated by OTBR to Thread device are available to be reached from infrastructure network.
  
  ```shell
  # Get OMR prefix with command otc br omrprefix
  bouffalolab />otc br omrprefix
  br omrprefix
  Local: fd41:20be:97bf:1::/64
  Favored: fd41:20be:97bf:1::/64 prf:low
  Done
  ```
  
- Get IPv6 Onlink prefix information from OTBR

    - Onlink prefix belongs Infrastructure network domain
    
    - IPv6 addresses using Onlink prefix are available to be reached from Thread network.
    
    ```shell
    # Get onlink prefix with command otc br onlinkprefix
    bouffalolab />otc br onlinkprefix
    br onlinkprefix
    Local: fd19:5f1c:33c6:41d5::/64
    Favored: fd19:5f1c:33c6:41d5::/64
    Done
    ```
    
- Open OTCLI UART, input the following commands to make OTCLI attach to OTBR Thread network.

    ```shell
    # Configure active dataset with command otc dataset set active 
    bouffalolab />otc dataset set active <Thread network credential hex string in last step>
    Done
    
    # Start Thread network with commands otc ifconfig up and otc thread start
    bouffalolab />otc ifconfig up
    ifconfig up
    Done
    
    bouffalolab />otc thread start
    thread start
    Done
    
    # Get Thread state with command otc state.
    # Try more times in seconds to check Thread state becomes to child/router
    bouffalolab />otc state
    state
    router
    Done
    
    # Get IP addresses with command otc ipaddr
    bouffalolab />otc ipaddr
    ipaddr
    fdef:ca56:3b51:5bf4:0:ff:fe00:6000
    fd41:20be:97bf:1:c017:4b66:f036:eb1a
    fdef:ca56:3b51:5bf4:a79:f4bc:cd40:d915
    fe80:0:0:0:bc2a:4222:ded0:7032
    Done
    ```

- Connectivity test between Thread device and PC station

  - PC station reaches Thread device

    IPv6 address fd41:20be:97bf:1:c017:4b66:f036:eb1a has prefix same as OMR prefix shown at OTBR as above, which is available to be access by a PC station in same AP router. `ping`  command from that PC station can reach this IPv6 address.

  - Thread device reaches PC station

    - Get IPv6 address with onlink prefix on target Host machine online linux shell terminal
